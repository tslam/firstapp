Your challenge for the weekend:

Make a Rails app that responds to at least two routes:

http://localhost:3000/am
http://localhost:3000/pm

The app should read from the same API as our Yearbook app did, (e.g., http://tslwebdev.herokuapp.com/SECTION.json) and generate appropriate responses for each request.
